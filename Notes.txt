Create basic node app in a directory.

Initialize 
    npm init

Install Express
    npm i express

-- write code in index.js file

Run the app
    node index.js

Now, create a docker file
    just create a file with name "dockerfile"
    without any extension

Install the Official Microsoft Extension for VS Code

-- write commands in dockerfile

Create a docker build for this app
    docker build -t basic-app .

An image for our app is created.
Now you  can run the image to form a container and expose it at same port/random port


Just like .gitignore, we can create a .dockerignore
    to ignore files which are not needed while building docker image.
    Example: node_modules - this is noot needed as we already have written RUN npm Install
    Which will create necessary node_modules.
    No need too push node_modules from local to image
